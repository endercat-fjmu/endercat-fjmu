Hi, I'm Ming from Fujian Medical University.

👋 Hello everyone, I'm Qin Xuanhao, a student at Fujian Medical University.

👀 I'm very interested in science and computer programming.

🌱 I'm currently learning chemistry, physics and Python programming.

💞️ I hope I can collaborate on some interesting projects with friends who are also interested in science and programming.

📫 I'd be happy to meet more friends!
